Title: Authored Books

During my career I had the pleasure to author books related to Software Engineering,

I'm primarily interested in showing different points of view over areas where
developers usually have a basic understanding but might lack a more in depth knowledge.

For example, in [Crafting Test Driven Software with Python](https://www.pythontdd.com) I approach testing
from the point of view of creating, growing and maintaining a complex testing suite
and how testing evolves together with the complexity of the software. I tried to
write a book that would be different from one more book explaining how to write tests.

In [Modern Python Standard Library Cookbook](https://www.pythonstandardlibrarybook.com/), 
I approached the standard library from
the point of view of showing new and interesting ways the standard Python modules
can be used. Showing for example how to write a Redis clone in few lines of code
combining the shelve and multiprocessing modules.
